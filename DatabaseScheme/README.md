# Database Scheme

#### This database must contain the informations about sensors and the data collected by them

It's based on two different tables related each others using the id of the sensor

In this repository i will ommit all the database implementation, it can be done with different server providers, i used MySQL, and the backend script works with it, but it's open to changes.
In particular i just provide the basic database creation instruction in [MessoriDatabaseScheme.txt](MessoriDatabaseScheme.txt)
